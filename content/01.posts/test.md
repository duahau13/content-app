Hello and welcome to this Nuxt i18n guide that will cover translating your Nuxt.js app into multiple languages. We’ll cover everything you need to know to make your Nuxt.js app multilingual. We’ll start by setting up the i18n package and managing translation files. You’ll learn how to switch languages, localize routes, and save language preferences.

We’ll also dive into supporting right-to-left languages, handling pluralization, and localizing dates, times, and currencies. Let’s get started on making your app truly global!
